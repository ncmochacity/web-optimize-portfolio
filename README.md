## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

The goal for this project was to optimize Cameron Pittman's portfolio page for pagespeed and better performance with rendering.
The strategy was to utilize skills attained in the Website Performance Optimization Course.
### Getting started

#### How to run
1. Git clone the repository or download the repository as a zip file
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ncmochacity/web-optimize-portfolio.git
```
1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```
### Pagespeed Optimizations
* Image compression: using Grunt responsive images for automating image compression
* Inlining CSS for minimizing render blocking CSS that speeds page loads
* Added a media attribute for "print" in the head tag for print styles
* Added the [async attribute] to all script tags

* [Measuring with Navigation Timing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/measure-crp.html "nav timing api"). We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
